#d is incorrect
#and b is incorrect
#hmmm
#so a or c
#ah
#should i choose 1 answer ?
#or many ?
#
#a. you can chain filters with filters and functions with functions but not mix them
#you can so it is false
#you can chain filters with functions ?
#how do you chain functions? i never saw that
#only filters
#have an example ?
#date()|date
#yes but that's not chaining functions
#that's chaining a filter after a function
#but you can't do
#date()|something()|else()
#can you ?
#date(random())
#okay so that's considered chaining
#alright
#b. you can chain anything seems to be correct
#c. you can access global vars only provided by Symfony on TwigBundle
#is incorrect
#d. there is only three global vars that come by default _self, _superglobals, _charset
#it is not _superglobals but _context
#e. if you want to use the c twig extension you have to change only a thing in your composer.json
#is a php extension so it is not installable with composer.json
#f. Twig is not anymore on PEAR
#is true
#g. Twig version 1.12.2 onwards are secure
#is false
#1.12.3 have serious security issues
#http://pear.twig-project.org/
#h. Twig 1.13 has a buggy C extension
#is correct
#it was very buggy
#crashed the C extension
#a lot
#let me remind you you can't access the internet
#yes i know, i just checked that now
#cause i was sure i saw it the other day
#on pear
#well it is discontinued
#it will not happen anymore
#alright
#enough with Twig
#that was intense
#that's exactly the type of question at the exam
#right ?
#you shall see it yourself when you take it

        question: 'in Symfony:'
        answers:
            - {value:
    a. GetSetMethodNormalizer is broken by design
    b. one can load normalizers and/or encoders by tagging them as serializer.normalizer and serializer.encoder respectiv    ely true makes the serializer available in the container and loads 3 encoders and 1 default normalizer
    d. JsonEncoder and XmlEncoder implement both EncoderInterface and DecoderInterface
    e. NormalizerInterface has methods normalize and supportsNormalization
    f. DenormalizerInterface has methods denormalize and supportsDenormalization but their methods have less arguments       than the normalizer

#a)don't know
#b)true)
#c)don't know
#d)true
#e)false
#f)don't know
#g. going from object to array is called normalizing, and from an array to JSON is called decoding
#g)false
#a is true
#The GetSetMethodNormalizer is broken by design. As soon as you have a circular object graph, an infinite loop is created when calling the getters. You're encouraged to add your own normalizers that fit your use-case.
#oops that's true
#b is true
#c is false, it does but it is only 2 encoders and no normalizers
#d is true
#e is true
#f is false, is the other way, the denormalizer method needs more arguments
#g is false
#think it as this
#Object is high in hierarchy
#then comes an array
#then a json string
#so going up means industry
#we normalize from array to object
#and we encode from json string to array
#(Y)
#we serialize because channels don't support objects
#so that is lower rank
#deserialization goes up in the chain until object
#is reached
#then we move them back up to objects
#right
#with normalization
#yes
#from array to object
#yes
#once json is decoded to array
#yes
#think enygma
#json is the papers with the letters
#object is the meaning
#array is in the process of decrypting
#we decode the letters
#and normalize the arrays to get the idea
#(Y)
#we denormalize an idea into an array and then encode it into a secret paper with letters
#alright
#next

18. In Symfony:
    a. There is a lesser known templating component with which you can build your own templating system not php and not     twig
    b. This component is heavily used by Twig
    c. Symfony has 27 components to this date
    d. Syfmony Translator component follows the same architecture for loaders than Twig does


a)false
b)false
c)true)
d)false
a is true
b is true in Symfony
c is true
d is true $translator->addLoader('array', new ArrayLoader());
oh
what's that templating component
?
/Users/cordoval/Sites/project/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Templating
ahh i didn't understand the question
of course you can build your own with the component
i thought there was already another templating engine
other than twig and php implemented
alright

19. in Symfony:
    a. There is a component that is only 6 classes, has no folder structure and is very simple. That is the Yaml    component.
    b. There is a component that is only 10 classes, has no folder structure and is very simple. That is the Yaml component
    c. The Dispatcher component is only 8 classes and the latest version passes also the dispatcher and the name of the event to the listener
    d. In Symfony, all the instances of the event_dispatcher are container aware by default unless you register a new event_dispatcher that does inject your services
    e. src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/config shows xml configuration for each service how the FrameworkBundle hooks special services of Symfony, it is also in charge to set the environment services, for instance test.client

a)true
b)false
3)true
d)false
a is false
b is true
e)true
c is true
d is true
e is true
event dispatcher is container aware ?
:)
Symfony is not the best framework sometimes between us :)
heh
it still works
alright
for some our use cases yeah
so yaml component has 10 classes ?
that's too big
6 plus 4 exception classes
20.
this part is the practical one
alright
should be better
paste here a gist with a subscriber implementation of what you remember of a subscriber doing the following
a. taking the response from the event and setting a cookie
b. write a twig filter and use a global twig parameter into that filter
c. use an annotation in an action with the ParameterConverter correctly
all those 3 are snippets
all those inside 1 subscriber ?
no
those are separate snippets
you cannot look up anything
send me the gists please
you have 5 minutes only
like this
...
?
yeah
send it quick 3 minutes
when we write a twig filter
we must implement it as part of a class
a twig extension
you want me to write the extension
?
you want me to implement a custom twig filter or simply use an existing one within a template ?
yeah, the extension

ah sorry

should be it
ok that is half a point
ok
we are done
okay
why half a point ?
because it was ok but not perfect
what are mistakes
i see
extending classes
oh twig extension
and also tags, namespaces, and also configuration directives
forgot to extend
and usage
